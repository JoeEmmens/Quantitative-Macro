My final project for the Quant Macro course 19-20.

The final project is titled:
"Does one need money to make money?" and is saved here under the same title.

I investigate the endogenous relationship between innovation and inequality using a discrete value function iteration model. Literature shows
that innovation concerntrates wealth in the hands of entrepreneurs since poorer agents are exluded by a minimum networth requirement and a higher 
propensity to save amongst entrepreneurs. I replicate the need for a minimum asset level to enter the entrepreneurial sector and show that 
shocking the economy with an exogenous increase in the persistance of idea shocks increases inequality and reduces innovation.
